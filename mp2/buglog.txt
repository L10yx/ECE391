1.
DESCRIPTION: 
    some stupid syntax confusion between C and C++
    error: 'for' loop initial declaration used outside C99 mode
SOLUTION:
    This error message indicates that in C code, I tried to declare a variable in the initialization part of the for loop 
    (i.e. inside the parentheses of the for loop), and this usage does not comply with the C99 standard or later. 
    So I declared index outside for loop.

2. 
DESCRIPTION: 
    status bar don't show
SOLUTION: 
    In modex.h, change #define IMAGE_Y_DIM  from 200 to 182 inspired by version checkpoint1 gradesheet
    for not showing full maze

description: when begin to move, there will be an original picture at starting point
SOLUTION:
    comment out         
    // draw_full_block(play_x, play_y, get_player_block(last_dir));
    // show_screen();

4:
DESCRIPTION:
    Bar did not display on screen
SOLUTION:    
    change
        /* One display page goes at the start of video memory. */
        target_img = 0x0000;
    =>
        target_img = 0x0600;    
    By changing the memory of status bar, it showed but still emulated
